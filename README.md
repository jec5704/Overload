# Overload
program that when run simulates the electrical system of a house, that uses user input to determine how the input affects the simulation

Using abstract classes and also through the concept of non-binary trees 
allow the user to interact with the simulation through user input,
you can add circuitbreakers, outlets and appliances to the simulated home and when the user turns 
the all of this equipment on, the program will determine wether the circuitbreakers 
should turn off if the charge applied is more than what it can take, the user can ask for help
entering h into the command line and the user can continue doing this doing until they enter
q for quitting the program. 

The program also reads redirected input in a format that will be demonstrated in some 
sample files in the repository, along with certain tests to make sure that the simulation
works correctly
